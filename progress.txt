3/7 - setup repository on github

3/9 - modified repository... added logo

3/11 - created sample go programs in repo

3/15 - 3/16 Literature research

3/16 - starting work on hill climbing algorithm

3/17 - researching in libraries and working on notes for stochastic gradient descent

3/18 - fixing up notes and continue on hill climbing

3/20 - more work on hill climbing and starting on random restart hill climbing

3/21 - hill climbing

3/22 and 3/23 - Learning some stuff about GO and working on hill climbing

3/24 - Research on Beam Search. Added TSP example.

3/25 - Added stochastic hill climbing

3/26 - Tweeked stochastic hill climbing, added a few more tests

3/26 and 3/27 - Working on tweeking Go compiler to allow option to not throw error for unused variables

3/27 - Modified compiler further so that it no longer throws errors for unused imports

3/31 - Added in beam search

4/2 - Added in stochastic beam search

4/3 - Modified stochastic beam search based on Pavlos's suggestions. Also looked up information on convergence of stochastic gradient descent

4/6 - Got plotinum working so that I can now plot the TSP solutions

4/7 - started on tabu search

4/8 - worked more on tabu search plus additional modifications of beam

4/9 - cleaned up tabu
