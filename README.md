A library for stochastic optimization in Go. This library is currently under construction, but I expect to have a first version ready by the end of my current semester.

For information on installing Go, please see http://golang.org/doc/install. For a useful video on getting started with Go if you already have some experience with other languages, see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCsL89YtqCs&list=FLmV-ax-PLJlTSIzLUxglj3w&index=2">this video</a>.
